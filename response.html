                  <h3><b>Site design</b></h3>
                  <p>
                    <b>1. Appearance-material:</b> Want something that provides a smooth visual transition between Kensington on the Park (KOP) on the east and Ezra on the west. <br> <span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>We are pleased to see that the comments do not ask us to transition to low-density housing, but it does ask for a visual/aesthetic transition between Kensington on the Park (KOP), and Ezra.  Over time the rest of these blocks will be developed, with potential additional heights provided at corner locations.  The proposed development, a 6 storey building, acts as the perfect intermediate solution between the modern 8 storey Ezra, and the more traditional KOP.  With building step-backs and the definition of other features that contribute to general form and shape, we will provide a sensitive transition to KOP. Through the additional mix of traditional materials such as brick, complimenting a more modern palette, our site will provide a perfect transition between Ezra, and future development on the block.</em><br><br>
                    <b>2. Community character:</b> Not overly modern/not too boxy, with good mix of material emphasizing brick/masonry. <br><span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>As previously mentioned, we will use materials that pay tribute to the character of some of the traditional elements of the community. E.g. brick.  Furthermore, we are providing a rhythm along the street through features that create a series of vertical elements similar to the scale of the infill housing within the community.  We will also incorporate design features such as a strong cornice line (a protruding horizontal trim/molding located at the top of wall) above the second storey, and a subsequent change of façade materials.</em><br><br>
                <b>3. Shadowing/height:</b> Concerned about losing sunlight to west facing patios and ground-level garden space in KOP & also to row of houses on the south-side of 5th Ave NW. <br><span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>Through shadow studies, we have determined that there will be some shadowing on some of the West facing units of KOP.  As the shadows are West, the sun will be quite low, and through shadow studies, we have determined that manipulating the massing of the upper stories on our site will have no significant impact on the shadowing of these balconies.  It should be noted that the sun in the summer months sets Northwest, meaning that past 6PM little shadowing will be cast form our building.  In this case, the trees in Riley park will continue to shade these balconies, as they always have. Overall, there will not be much shadowing before 4 pm and after 8 pm year-round. For more information, please refer to our <a href ="https://www.fiveeleven.ca/design/#shadowstudies" target="_blank"><b><u>Shadow studies</u></b></a>.</em><br><br>
                                      <b>4. Building setbacks:</b> Emulate something between those of KOP and Ezra.</p>

                  <h3><b>Mobility</b></h3>
                    <p>                     <b>1. Parking:</b> Provide enough on-site parking for residents and visitors too. <br> <span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>We are constantly attempting to navigate the tension between the desire of the City to provide less parking, and communities, which typically want more.  Although we expect a significant parking relaxation being granted by the City due to location and proximity to transit networks, such as an LRT station, we will be seeking only a small relaxation of 5 stalls. The parkade is maximized at one storey and will provide adequate parking at this location.  The cost of an additional level of parkade could only be offset by additional units and density, resulting in a larger project with greater impact on the community.</em><br><br>
                    <b>2. Bike Lanes:</b> Those on north-side of 5th Ave NW take away visitor parking for maintenance vehicles & visitors to single-detached units. <br><span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>Although it is unfortunate that bike lanes along 5th may have impacted the availability of street parking for some residents, bike lanes fall outside of the scope of our work, and we recommend that concerned residents contact the Ward 7 office for further discussion. It should also be noted that permit street parking will not be available to residents in our development, as permits are not granted to multi family projects.</em><br><br>
                <b>3. Pedestrian realm:</b> Attractive and consistent appearance along 5th Ave: wide sidewalks, tree lined street, traffic-calming + slowing designs, clear crossings. <br><span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>We will work together with City staff, community association, our landscape architect, and developer to come up with a meaningful pedestrian experience.  We will be exploring various design options such as boulevard trees, that can be planted at the front, and will create a landscape buffer using a mix of hard and soft landscaping options to create a transition between the public space of the sidewalk, and semi-private patios.  While we will work toward designing a great sidewalk that provides a safe environment for pedestrians, the traffic on 5th, already limited to 40km/h, is outside the immediate scope of our work.</em></p>

                    <p>                     <b>1. Affordability:</b> Can a regular working family afford units here? <br> <span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>This project is planned as a rental of a reasonable standard.  This means market rates will be set and may not be consistent with everyone’s notion of affordability or obtainability.  As a simple answer to the question: “Can a regular working family afford this?”; most families can, but not everyone.</em><br><br>
                    <b>2. Family-friendly housing provision:</b> 3 bedroom units are important in attracting younger supplies who are in short supply in the area. Will contribute to wider community vibrancy. <br><span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>It is our intent to provide a limited number of 3-bedroom units.  Although the market often pushes growing families into single family, townhouse, or row-house development, we will still offer the options of 3-bedroom units.</em><br><br>
                <b>3. Age + ability-friendly:</b> Can seniors and those with physical impairments access this? Consider having some senior-specific design units on the ground floor. <br><span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>The building is going to have barrier free access from the street, and the parkade will have an elevator.  While we are not planning on providing adaptable units at this point, however, with an elevator, great lighting and generous corridors, this building will accommodate most people with limited mobility, including many looking to age in place.</em></p>

Safety-features:</b> Non-intrusive lighting. <br> <span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>We’ve heard complaints from area residents about light pollution from the Ezra, which necessitated the purchase of window shading.  Therefore, we will collaborate with our lighting consultant to ensure dark sky lighting design for the exterior, meaning little or no light will spill past our property.  We will also address potential SPTED (Site Protection through Environmental Design) issues through designing strategic lighting and increasing eyes on the public space.</em><br><br>
                    <b>2. Traffic + speed management:</b> Measures that limit non-local traffic and lower vehicle speeds. <br><span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>The traffic on 5th, and any calming that may be desired, fall outside the scope of this development, as noted previously.  We will provide a safe zone for pedestrians around our site. Furthermore, as the rear lane is narrow, and we are prepared to pave it, we are willing to place some traffic calming measures there, if so desired.</em><br><br>
                <b>3. Aesthetics:</b> Paving, attractive colors, mural space. <br><span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>We will work together with City planning and design teams and our landscape Architect to provide an attractive and  meaningful urban context through paving patterns, colours, and a mixture of soft and hard landscaping.  The focus will be on the site faces fronting on 5th as well as Riley Park.</em><br><br>

Noise:</b> Increased decibel levels throughout construction period. <br> <span style="font-size:60px;line-height:1em;opacity:0.2">❝</span><em>The developer will also be the contractor for this project. Our team is skilled and has extensive experience with tightly constrained inner-city sites.  While construction of this building will have some impact on nearby residents, we will do our best to minimize this.  For example, permits for lane closures will have to be requested, and noise bylaws will have to be adhered to.  It is also our recent experience that most contractors and sub-contractors are acutely aware of the need for sensitivity when working in an area near families and behave accordingly.</em> </p>

While we love this idea personally, it is not a viable business plan and would complicate this application significantly.  Some of the reasons include:<br><br>
•	The lane and row of trees create a strong boundary between our site and the Park,<br>
•	It is too removed from the highly dense Kensington Retail strip,<br>
•	It would complicate loading, waste and recycling pick up and visitor parking in the lane.  <br><br>

In summary, any sort of retail use would be a better opportunity for a lot that is not mid- block like ours.</em></p>
